**Sprite Nodes: 
1. Blood Cells (x4)
2. Antibodies (x4) 
3. Vaccine (x1) 
5. Coronavirus (x1)
4. Antigens (x4-5 per frame, x5 different in total) 

**How to Play: 

A. Score Points - 
+. In order to score points you must matches the antibody with the antigen or the vaccine to the coronavirus. Killing an antigen will score you 15 points.

C. Antigens -
+. There are 4 different antigens. Each antigen has a specific epitope and different color. 
+. The Epitope and the color must match the antibody in order to get rid of the antigen. 
+. After killing one antigen, another will reappear. Antigens won't lose you any points if you hit the bloodCell but will give you some points if you kill it with an antibody

D. Antibody -
+. There are 4 different antibodies for each antigen. The colors are similar to virus. The paratope of the antibody must match with the epitope of the antigen to kill it
